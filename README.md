# SK-Charities

This is an app created for SKCharities, which facilitates donations of sports gear to third world countries. 

We began the app during a hackathon of sorts (Sunday 4/21/19) where we built out the front end and began planning the backend. We are continuing to develop. 

It will be created in xcode, with swift as the primary language. The backend will be implemented in Mysql and php (using a hosting service) 
See the file called 'specifications' for an outline of features we plan to implement. 
Team member names and roles are below.
