This document is a list of planned features, and a general brainstorm from our meeting on 4/21. It is subject (and likely!) to change! 

Login page (google login api for secure password handling) 
Donations or accept donations – two different types of accounts
Concussion awareness program? (possibly not in this app) 
(?) Third login page for concussion awareness schedules, see if they’d like to schedule one

They should be able to put name, what kind of gear they’d like to donate, all goes into a database
Should be able to access database and contact college for what kind of gear they’d like to donate
Once they click Concussion Awareness they’d be able to go to a calendar and schedule new events, or maybe figure out what events have already been scheduled
Wireframing- come up with how each page of the app will look like
1)	Page where the person can input donations or gear into a database
a.	Login, and they’ll put in name, contact information, school
b.	Next page will have a textbox where they register what kind of gear they have
i.	Jerseys, shorts, athletic gear, helmets, shoes
c.	Upload pictures of the stuff and add a description that goes along with it
d.	Messaging component to get each other’s contact information? – nah doesn’t need to be messaging
2)	Someone who can accept donations and see what they want donated
a.	Login, put their information (type of gear, which college)
b.	Messaging system within the app so that they can directly connect with each other
c.	Sends an email to the person – goes through a verification process
d.	How much of a certain quantity can be ordered on the ordering page.
3)	Concussion awareness program- see calendar and/or input events
a.	People who login propose the date that they’d like to have the person come in to speak
b.	Only the person
c.	Receive information via email
